## Getting started

You can implement the Button component by importing the `ButtonComponent` into your NgModule / Standalone Component.

```ts
import { ButtonComponent } from "@library/button";
```

The button has to one required attribute: `label`. The `label` specifies the button label text as a string.
You can also optionally configure a type of button by specifying a `type` attribute on the button.

## Usage guidelines

Avoid using the button as a link and vice-versa. It is a good idea to provide semantic labels, that give the user an idea of the action behind the button. Try to be more specific than `New` or `Save`,
e.g. try using `Create new item` or `Update item`.
